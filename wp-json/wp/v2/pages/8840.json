The ways in which myths and fairy tales offer us a more enriching set of values to live by. These are the stories which remind us that, tucked up safe in the rambling, roundabout lines between once upon a time and happily ever after, lie all the secrets for a meaningful, sustainable life. They show us what it might be like to inhabit a world in which humans are fully enmeshed. In this world, animals always have something to teach us, trees and plants can save or cure us, and wise old men and women are waiting in the dark woods to help us. That sense of awe, of connection, of belonging to a mysterious world which has many depths and layers to explore, is missing in so much of our lives today. What I\u2019m passionate about, in both my writing and teaching, is capturing the imagination, and conveying that sense of living in a world saturated with enchantment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><strong><span>What was the book that made you first want to become an author?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>I was a voracious reader as a small child, and a great lover of myths and fairy tales. But there was something about Victoria Walker\u2019s <em>The Winter of Enchantment<\/em> (which, according to my scribbles on the inside cover of the battered copy I still carry around with me, I read when I was 10) that really captured my imagination. I read it again and again. Somehow, this other world that she invented was infinitely more real and desirable to me than those in the Enid Blyton books, with their rather more \u2018twee\u2019 fairylands, that I\u2019d been given when I was younger. I went on from there very rapidly to discover Ursula Le Guin\u2019s <em>Earthsea<\/em> trilogy, Tolkien, and similar creators of other worlds, but it was Walker\u2019s book that first introduced me to fantasy and mythic fiction. It helped me understand how it was possible to translate a love of myth and folklore into a new work of fiction that could captivate, and it made me want to create my own worlds in which I could help readers not only find pleasure, but depth \u2013 and ultimately, ways of reimagining themselves.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;2_5&#8243; disabled_on=&#8221;on|on|off&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.24.0&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#282723&#8243; background_image=&#8221;https:\/\/sharonblackie.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/Mute-swan-Oyvind-Martinsen-OPT.jpg&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;5%|5%|5%|5%|true&#8221; custom_padding_tablet=&#8221;35%||35%||true|false&#8221; custom_padding_phone=&#8221;&#8221; custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;About Section&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;2_5,3_5&#8243; use_custom_gutter=&#8221;on&#8221; gutter_width=&#8221;0&#8243; make_equal=&#8221;on&#8221; admin_label=&#8221;About Area&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.27.2&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#44393d&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; min_height=&#8221;1056px&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||138px|||&#8221; use_custom_width=&#8221;on&#8221; width_unit=&#8221;off&#8221; custom_width_percent=&#8221;100%&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;2_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.27.2&#8243; background_enable_color=&#8221;off&#8221; use_background_color_gradient=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color_gradient_direction=&#8221;357deg&#8221; background_color_gradient_stops=&#8221;#44393d 0%|rgba(68,57,61,0) 53%&#8221; background_color_gradient_overlays_image=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color_gradient_start=&#8221;#44393d&#8221; background_color_gradient_end=&#8221;rgba(68,57,61,0)&#8221; background_color_gradient_end_position=&#8221;53%&#8221; background_image=&#8221;https:\/\/sharonblackie.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/Boxing-hares-SD-OPT.jpg&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;7%|5%|7%|5%|true|false&#8221; custom_padding_tablet=&#8221;46%||46%||true|false&#8221; custom_padding_phone=&#8221;&#8221; custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;3_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#44393d&#8221; background_enable_image=&#8221;off&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;5%|5%|5%|5%|true&#8221; custom_padding_tablet=&#8221;||11%||false|false&#8221; custom_padding_phone=&#8221;&#8221; custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; text_text_color=&#8221;#fcfcf2&#8243; header_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_2_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_2_font_size=&#8221;27px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.1em&#8221; header_3_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_3_font_size=&#8221;23px&#8221; header_3_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_4_text_color=&#8221;#c34d49&#8243; header_4_line_height=&#8221;2.5em&#8221; min_height=&#8221;806.6px&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;||-133px|||&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0%||1vw||false|false&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Did you always want to be a writer?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Literature was hugely influential in my life from the moment when I first learned to read, but when I was young, I never thought working-class girls like me could be writers. The first books I was given to read as a small child were decidedly middle-class. Although I grew up on Enid Blyton, I couldn\u2019t ever really relate to the children in her books; their lives were utterly foreign to me. Then, at school, we never read contemporary novels in literature classes, but rather the so-called \u2018classics\u2019 \u2013 and they too were written by people who all seemed to be from middle- or upper-class backgrounds. So it took a while, until I was in my early teens and came across a more contemporary bunch of writers from backgrounds that were rather more like mine, for me to understand that it was possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>During my early years of high school, we were asked to write a \u2018novel\u2019 in English class. (Mine was in the science fiction genre.) Of course, I\u2019m talking about a tiny, tiny word count. But even so, we had to think about plot, and characters, and themes, and all of the things we\u2019d studied in the novels we\u2019d read and dissected over the years. What I created wasn\u2019t exactly a masterpiece, but I loved the challenge of putting it together. I think that was the point at which I became hooked.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Why did you want to be a writer, and why do you still want to be?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Because I had found books to be so transformative in my own young life. They\u2019d shown me different ways of being in the world \u2013 and don\u2019t forget, I grew up in a world in which there was no internet, and we never had the ability to travel, so books really were the only way I had of experiencing the world outside of my own very narrow upbringing. For most of my childhood, we didn\u2019t have a TV \u2013 but we lived very close to a wonderful small library, and I devoured several books a week. The books I read expanded my consciousness and introduced me to a universe of ideas which fascinated me. The idea that I might one day write books which were similarly transformative for others was a huge motivator. It still is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;About Section&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;3_5,2_5&#8243; use_custom_gutter=&#8221;on&#8221; gutter_width=&#8221;0&#8243; make_equal=&#8221;on&#8221; admin_label=&#8221;About Area&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.24.0&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#44393d&#8221; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|&#8221; use_custom_width=&#8221;on&#8221; width_unit=&#8221;off&#8221; custom_width_percent=&#8221;100%&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;3_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.24.0&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; background_enable_image=&#8221;off&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;7%|5%|11%|5%|false|false&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.27.4&#8243; text_text_color=&#8221;#fcfcf2&#8243; header_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_2_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_2_font_size=&#8221;27px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.1em&#8221; header_3_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_3_font_size=&#8221;23px&#8221; header_3_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_4_text_color=&#8221;#c34d49&#8243; header_4_line_height=&#8221;2.5em&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;||-70px|||&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0%||0%||true|false&#8221; hover_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; sticky_enabled=&#8221;0&#8243;]<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Which were the books that you found especially transformative?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Oh goodness \u2013 so many. But I can point to two in particular. When I was 16 and studying for \u2018A\u2019 level English literature, the first novel we were offered was <em>The Rainbow<\/em>, by D.H. Lawrence. That shook me to the core, and it\u2019s still one of my favourite books ever. It was the ways in which the characters were so attuned to the rhythms of the earth, and then the inexorable rise of what Lawrence called \u2018the Machine\u2019 \u2013 of industrialisation. The profoundly sensual imagery took hold of me \u2013 Anna and Will dancing in a hayfield, for example \u2013 and it\u2019s stayed with me ever since. And then, around the same time, for \u2018A\u2019 level French literature, we studied Albert Camus\u2019 <em>L\u2019\u00c9tranger<\/em>. Again, that opened up a whole world of philosophical ideas that occupied me for years.<\/span><strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When I was older, just heading into my twenties, Virago Modern Classics changed everything for me. They offered so many insights into so many different ways of being a woman. Being published by Virago was a very early, seemingly impossible dream, and it still feels like that to me today, even though they published my most recent book.<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What got you started as a writer?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>Finally having a story to tell. I tried several times in my twenties and thirties to construct a novel (I always and only ever wanted to write novels) but somehow my heart wasn\u2019t in it. I think perhaps that\u2019s because I was living the wrong life at the time. It wasn\u2019t till I was in my late thirties, living in America, working again in a corporate job, and on my third major midlife crisis, that I began to find that necessary story. At that time, I needed to finally break out of the corporate world that I\u2019d reverted to after a messy and expensive divorce, but an impoverished and challenging childhood had made me always fearful and far too hung up on security. One day, shortly after JF Kennedy Jr had died piloting his small airplane, I took it into my head that I needed to learn to fly. It might sound crazy, but it made perfect sense to me at the time \u2013 because I was afraid of flying. And I had come to believe that if I didn\u2019t find some way to break out of the anxiety and fear that seemed to be dominating my life, and stare death right in the face, I\u2019d never really learn to fully live. Well, to cut a long story short, it worked. Several months later, I was handed the pink piece of paper which would enable me to apply for my private pilot\u2019s license by a crusty old ex-US Marine, in the heart of the New Mexico desert. It had been a long and profoundly transformative journey, and by the end of it I figured that if I could do that, I could do anything. So I handed in my notice, bought a small rundown croft on the far north-west coast of Scotland, and reimagined my life. Shortly afterwards I fulfilled that childhood dream and wrote my first book \u2013 a novel, <em>The Long Delirious Burning Blue<\/em>, which incorporated some of that flying journey, as well as a healthy dose of folklore and selkie stories.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;2_5&#8243; disabled_on=&#8221;on|on|off&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.24.0&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#282723&#8243; background_image=&#8221;https:\/\/sharonblackie.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/Stormy-bog-SD-OPT-1.jpg&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;5%|5%|5%|5%|true&#8221; custom_padding_tablet=&#8221;35%||35%||true|false&#8221; custom_padding_phone=&#8221;&#8221; custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#44393d&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;4vw||4vw||true|false&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; background_size=&#8221;initial&#8221; background_position=&#8221;top_left&#8221; background_repeat=&#8221;repeat&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; custom_padding=&#8221;|||&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.21.0&#8243; text_text_color=&#8221;#fcfcf2&#8243; header_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_2_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_2_font_size=&#8221;27px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.1em&#8221; header_3_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_3_font_size=&#8221;23px&#8221; header_3_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_4_text_color=&#8221;#c34d49&#8243; header_4_line_height=&#8221;2.5em&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What do you love most, and hate most, about being a writer?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>I love the freedom to work when it suits you. I love the immersion into my own imaginal world \u2013 isn\u2019t it amazing that this is my actual job?! I love language, agonising over precisely the right words and images; I&#8217;m a punctuation perfectionist, too. I love threading myth into the story-cloth; it feels like the most profound act of creation \u2013 like weaving the world into being. I love hearing from readers that my books have changed them, or helped them to see something in their lives more clearly, or to understand themselves better.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I don\u2019t hate much about it. Sometimes, I struggle with book deadlines \u2013 not because I\u2019m bad at keeping to them: quite the opposite. But if I\u2019m not careful, they can hem me in and kill inspiration. Sometimes, books need longer to incubate than you\u2019d first imagined; deadlines run the risk of cutting that process short. Sometimes I\u2019m frustrated by the need to spend long hours at a computer. Then of course, there are the days when coherent and beautiful words just won\u2019t come, and you have to learn to walk away.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What is your writing process?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>I write in the mornings; it just doesn\u2019t seem to work for me in the afternoons \u2013 I&#8217;m a super-early riser, so maybe I\u2019m just too tired by then, and all out of words. The way I write depends on what I\u2019m writing, so fiction seems to require a different process from nonfiction. Nonfiction is more like work. That doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t enjoy it, but there\u2019s always quite a bit of research to do, and ideas to consciously weave in. Fiction is much less conscious. It\u2019s more like doing magic. I always write nonfiction at my desk; fiction always begins cosied up in a comfortable armchair with a laptop. I dream my way into fiction; nonfiction is a more intellectual process. With fiction, I love the very early morning dreamtime, when I\u2019m not long out of bed, and I can sit quietly before the day has begun for anyone else. That\u2019s my most productive time.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What are some of the themes that have preoccupied you?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>I\u2019d say there are two threads which make their way into everything I write, in one way or another. First: the possibility, and the necessity, of change. All of the ways in which we transform ourselves throughout our lives. I believe very strongly that we\u2019re not meant to be static, to somehow \u2018settle into ourselves\u2019 and consider that\u2019s the job done. If we\u2019re not changing, we\u2019re not learning and we\u2019re not growing. I\u2019m not talking about change for change\u2019s sake; I\u2019m talking about an organic process of adapting to the flow of our lives, of living in a state of constant becoming.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>Second: place as one of the greatest teachers in our lives. We have a tendency to focus on people as teachers, and of course they are \u2013 but so are places. Place defines, and perhaps confines, our possibilities and our choices. Places reflect us back at ourselves in so many different ways. The person I am in the desert is different from the person I am by the sea. The landscape awakens different facets of who I am, and who I might one day become.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What advice would you give to budding writers?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>More than anything \u2013 learn the craft. Put the time in; appreciate the necessity of apprenticeship to the craft of writing. It\u2019s not easy, and it takes time. Don\u2019t think it doesn\u2019t matter if your grammar isn\u2019t great, or if you can\u2019t punctuate to save your life. It does matter. There\u2019s only so much a copyeditor can fix. Having a good story isn\u2019t enough; you have to learn how to craft a good scene, create characters that people can believe in, and so much more. Perhaps more than anything, when you\u2019re learning that craft, learn also to take constructive criticism. Don\u2019t just look for praise or pats on the back, or you\u2019ll never grow as a writer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><strong><span>What is your most beloved and well-read book?<\/span><\/strong><span>\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span>I have so many that have travelled with me around the world, from house to house. But if I were to pick one that I return to again and again during this stage in my life, it would be Terry Pratchett\u2019s <em>Wyrd Sisters<\/em>, as well as his other books that feature that wonderful old witch, Granny Weatherwax. It always frustrates me when Pratchett is written off as \u2018just\u2019 a comic writer, although those attitudes seem to be shifting a little now; there\u2019s a depth to his witch books which I adore. I particularly love that his witches are products of their places, and especially the geology on which they live \u2013 Granny Weatherwax could never be anything other than a granite witch. \u2018Witches is a different thing altogether. [&#8230;] It&#8217;s magic out of the ground, not out of the sky\u2019, she says in <em>Equal Rites<\/em>. A few hours in her company settles me when nothing else will, and I for sure plan to model my old age on her. She is my favourite fictional character in the whole world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; admin_label=&#8221;About Section&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#893E39&#8243; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px|&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_row column_structure=&#8221;2_5,3_5&#8243; use_custom_gutter=&#8221;on&#8221; gutter_width=&#8221;0&#8243; make_equal=&#8221;on&#8221; admin_label=&#8221;About Area&#8221; _builder_version=&#8221;4.27.2&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#893E39&#8243; width=&#8221;100%&#8221; max_width=&#8221;100%&#8221; custom_margin=&#8221;0px||0px&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;0px||0px||false|false&#8221; use_custom_width=&#8221;on&#8221; width_unit=&#8221;off&#8221; custom_width_percent=&#8221;100%&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;2_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.27.2&#8243; background_enable_color=&#8221;off&#8221; use_background_color_gradient=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color_gradient_direction=&#8221;357deg&#8221; background_color_gradient_stops=&#8221;#44393d 0%|rgba(68,57,61,0) 53%&#8221; background_color_gradient_overlays_image=&#8221;on&#8221; background_color_gradient_start=&#8221;#44393d&#8221; background_color_gradient_end=&#8221;rgba(68,57,61,0)&#8221; background_color_gradient_end_position=&#8221;53%&#8221; background_image=&#8221;https:\/\/sharonblackie.net\/wp-content\/uploads\/VOTW-header-2-OPT.jpg&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;7%|5%|7%|5%|true|false&#8221; custom_padding_tablet=&#8221;46%||46%||true|false&#8221; custom_padding_phone=&#8221;&#8221; custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][\/et_pb_column][et_pb_column type=&#8221;3_5&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; background_color=&#8221;#893E39&#8243; background_enable_image=&#8221;off&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;5%|5%|5%|5%|true&#8221; custom_padding_tablet=&#8221;||11%||false|false&#8221; custom_padding_phone=&#8221;&#8221; custom_padding_last_edited=&#8221;on|tablet&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; custom_padding__hover=&#8221;|||&#8221;][et_pb_text _builder_version=&#8221;4.16&#8243; text_text_color=&#8221;#fcfcf2&#8243; header_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_2_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_2_font_size=&#8221;27px&#8221; header_2_line_height=&#8221;1.1em&#8221; header_3_text_color=&#8221;#893e39&#8243; header_3_font_size=&#8221;23px&#8221; header_3_line_height=&#8221;1.2em&#8221; header_4_text_color=&#8221;#c34d49&#8243; header_4_line_height=&#8221;2.5em&#8221; custom_padding=&#8221;30px||0vw||false|false&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221;]<\/p>\n<p><strong><span>Is there a book that broke your heart?<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span>I wrote about this one in <em>If Women Rose Rooted<\/em>, so perhaps I\u2019ll just quote from that book:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><em><span>One week just before the Christmas of 2009, taking some rare time out, I read<\/span><\/em><span> The Crossing, <em>the middle book in McCarthy\u2019s \u2018Border Trilogy\u2019.\u00a0 It is the story of a boy who lives on a cattle ranch, and rescues a she-wolf from a trap he himself has set.

He travels with the injured and wary wolf, developing a deep bond with her, but once they\u2019re in Mexico she is captured by officials who impound her and hand her over to a group of local men.
